<p>Current COVID-19 Tier hospitality restrictions are putting particular pressure on our little village pub due to its limited availability of dining tables.</p>
<p>In an attempt to attain viable trade, balanced with customer safety regulations, we have been forced to implement the following provisional dining-in terms:</p>
<h4 id="sittings">Sittings</h4>
<p>Tables are normally bookable in two-hour slots with the main food services occasionally operating two sittings.</p>
<h4 id="booking-fee">Booking Fee</h4>
<p>During some busy evening services there may be a non-returnable reservation fee payable when you book. This fee is fully redeemable on the night against your food and drink bill.</p>
<hr>
<p>Booking terms &amp; conditions will be explained at the time of booking. However, if you have any questions please call <strong>Paula</strong> on <strong>07912 868111</strong></p>
<p>We apologise for any inconvenience this unusual approach may cause. However, given the acute financial pressures of the current extraordinary trade restrictions levied against small hospitality businessâ€™ like ourselves; with our limiting dining tables, we have no choice but employ these interim measures in order to best balance the interests of the business, staff and customers.</p>
