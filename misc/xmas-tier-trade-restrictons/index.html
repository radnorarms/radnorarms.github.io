<h1 id="christmas-day-and-new-years-eve">Christmas Day and New Years Eve</h1>
<p>Current COVID-19 Tier hospitality restrictions are putting particular pressure on our little village pub due to its limited availability of dining tables.</p>
<p>In an attempt to attain viable trade, balanced with customer safety regulations, we have been forced to implement the following provisional dining-in terms:</p>
<h4 id="sittings">Sittings</h4>
<p>From 5.00pm must be booked for either food or drinks; tables are bookable in two-hour slots with the main food services operating two sittings.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:left"></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Sitting #1</td>
<td style="text-align:left">5.30pm – 7.30pm</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">Sitting #2</td>
<td style="text-align:left">7.30pm – close (last food service at 8.30pm)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4 id="booking-fee">Booking Fee</h4>
<p>Due to limited tables there is a table booking fee of £10.00 per person, minimum charge of £40.00. This table booking fee is non-refundable but can be redeemed against the bill on the night of booking.</p>
<hr>
<p>Booking terms &amp; conditions will be explained at the time of booking. However, if you have any questions please call <strong>Paula</strong> on <strong>07912 868111</strong></p>
<p>We apologise for any inconvenience this unusual approach may cause. However, given the acute financial pressures of the current extraordinary trade restrictions levied against small hospitality business’ like ourselves; with our limiting dining tables, we have no choice but employ these interim measures in order to best balance the interests of the business, staff and customers.</p>
